# Buffer-Overflows

I'm new to this.
A lot of people are prepping for OSCP but cannot find good scripts in Python3.

Have at them because here they are.  I built them to work through Ti3rius's TryHackMe room https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep
Tib3rius goes through all of this stuff in the room and on their github https://github.com/Tib3rius/Pentest-Cheatsheets/blob/master/exploits/buffer-overflows.rst

Like all things in cyber, things deprecate. As of Oct 2020, these Python3 scripts should work.
P.s. I'm not a Python developer. I'm a Jack of all trades. So my code is simple and straightforward. Make a pull request if you want to make it look prettier. Please make a branch.

I'll go through and clean this up a bit as I have time.
